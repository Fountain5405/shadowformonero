# Parsing Shadow Log Messages

While Shadow may attempt to log messages that contain useful system information,
no attempt is made to keep these message consistent or stable over time. Thus,
the log messages should generally not be parsed by users because any parsing
tools may break at any time when Shadow is updated.
